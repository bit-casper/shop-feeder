Notes

    celery -A webshop_manager worker -l info




TODO


- tasks.py - mapped fields works in same cases. Palby "OnHandAvailPhysical" specifically doesn't work according to logs from latest test.
- tasks.py -> sync_feed_to_shops() is currently creating multiple products because the for-loop is arranged wrong.
- Find out if we can fetch all inventory_id's from a shop, if not we need to manually put them in shop object on creation.
- tasks.py -> sync_feed_to_shops() is currently creating products, we need it to only update existing products. This is why we need inventory_id
- Move sync buttom from feed to shop





FIXED
