Uniconta API endpoints list:

Shopify rest api is legacy, they recommend all apps start implementing GraphQL Admin API.
Here is a quick Python example of Shopify GraphQL:

TODO

    How we will handle Uniconta:


- Create a Client model which needs to contain Shops and Feeds.
- Login Dashboard needs to be a list of clients. Clicking on a client takes us to the current dashboard, showing shops and feeds.

- When creating product, we get 'product_id', 'sku' and 'inventory_item_id' in response.json() 
    We should save these in the database so we can always look up those id's locally, letting us save api calls later

- Cleanup: Move utility functions (non decorated functions) from tasks.py to utils.py

- tasks.py -> sync_feed_to_shops() is currently creating products, we need it to only update existing products. This is why we need inventory_id
- Move sync buttom from feed to shop
- More detailed logging (Would be nice to see which data was updated and the before and after values)




FIXED

- tasks.py - mapped fields works in same cases. Palby "OnHandAvailPhysical" specifically doesn't work according to logs from latest test, trying to push N/A when its actually 0.00
- tasks.py -> sync_feed_to_shops() is currently creating multiple products because the for-loop is arranged wrong.
