TODO


__SYNC TASK__
- Find out if we can fetch all inventory_id's from a shop, if not we need to manually put them in shop object on creation.
- tasks.py -> sync_feed_to_shops() is currently creating products, we need it to only update existing products. This is why we need inventory_id

Look at tasks.py line 85+
And views.py line 198
Need to fix shopify push for all products in the feed.

- Move sync buttom from feed to shop





FIXED

- tasks.py -> sync_feed_to_shops() is currently creating multiple products because the for-loop is arranged wrong.
